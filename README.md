 ## Requirements
the only thing you needs is to install the below softwares:
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
 - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

 ## Installation

### Development Setup:
the first thing is editing some of the config files to complete the setup. edit the EMAIL CONFIG and SECRET_KEY from [/config/django.dev.env](#dajngo-config)

>**Tip:** The place all development config is /config/ folder with pattern *[config-name].dev.env*

**[SECRET_KEY](#dajngo-config) :**  We recommend generating a new secret key and filling it with that. how generate a secret key? the easiest way to generate is this website [djecrety.ir](https://djecrety.ir/).
or following the [official document of python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) to generate the new secret key.

**[EMAIL CONFIG](#dajngo-config):** in this section, you should config your email settings this config is used for sending some emails like activation codes and verifying codes to users. for more information how to fill this section you can read this page

after complate the configs your should run this script in your terminal :

     ./install-service.dev.sh
this command build the images and run the containter.
> **Now you can access the platform with your localhost IP on the port 8000**

The next step is creating a new superuser, but the default superuser is inactivated so you should active this with the API endpoint, basically, after creating a new user you must request to send a confirmation code to your email, then send the code you received to an endpoint to confirm and activate your account/user,
but you can create a new active superuser so easily by this command without any confirmation email:

    ./django-manager.sh createactivesuperuser

there are some scripts available for convenience like :

**django-manager.sh :**
 - > alternative for manage.py of Django but in the container, you can use it like normal manage.py

**start-service.dev.sh :**
 - > Starting Faino development environment again, after changing some of the configs or when is stopping

**stop-service.sh :**
 - > Stoping Faino Development Environment

### Production Setup:
For installing production mode, you must fill all the below config files:
- [Django config](#dajngo-config)
- [Gunicorn config](#gunicorn-config)
- [Postgres config](#postgres-config)


**[SECRET_KEY](#dajngo-config) :**   the easiest way to generate is this website [djecrety.ir](https://djecrety.ir/).
or following the [official document of python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html) to generate the new secret key.

>**Tip:** The place all production config is /config/ folder with pattern *[service-name].prod.env*

if you don't know how to fill config files you can go to the [Configs](#configs) section or you can use [development configs](#development-setup) as a reference.

after complate the configs your should run this script in your terminal :

    $ ./install-service.prod.sh
this command build the images and run the containter.

> **Now you can access the platform with your localhost IP on the port 80**

The next step is creating a new superuser, but the default superuser is inactivated so you should active this with the API endpoint, basically, after creating a new user you must request to send a confirmation code to your email, then send the code you received to an endpoint to confirm and activate your account/user,
but you can create a new active superuser so easily by this command without any confirmation email:

    ./django-manager.sh createactivesuperuser

there are some scripts available for convenience like :

**django-manager.sh :**
 - > alternative for manage.py of Django but in the container, you can use it like normal manage.py

**start-service.prod.sh :**
 - > Starting Faino production environment again
 
**stop-service.sh :**
 - > Stoping Faino Development Environment
